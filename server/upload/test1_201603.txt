Different people have different hobbies. Some like painting or drawing while others love playing basketball. I have many hobbies because I like to do many things. Let me share a few of my hobbies with you.  To begin with, I really go in for sports, both indoors and outdoors. I like collecting cards and playing card games with my friends. But my favorite games are video games. I could play them all day long. I am for being outside in the fresh air and sunshine, too. I like riding very much, but swimming is my favorite sport.   In addition, I like to draw pictures and read comics. Listening to music and singing songs are things I enjoy too. Now I'm learning how to play an instrument--the guitar. Finally, I enjoy learning English because I like speaking with foreigners and I like watching Disney cartoons.   As you can see, my hobbies keep me busy and excited. I'm always looking for new things to do
