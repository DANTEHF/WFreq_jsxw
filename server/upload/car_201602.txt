Professor Huntington's paper greatly inspired me. According to him, in a 
plural/pluralistic society, there 
will inevitably be different opinions. The key is to deal with them in such a way 
that they can play a constructive rather than destructive role.   He argues that in a 
plural/pluralistic society we must stress/attach importance to 
interpersonal relationships, cooperation, and looking at issues from the perspective of other people. If some groups regard themselves as superior and treat other 
ethnic groups or 
religions with disrespect, the whole society may be paralyzed.   I am convinced that if we put into practice the ideas mentioned above, then there is the possibility of creating a new civilization.
I should certainly hesitate to hire a clerk on his face/appearance alone. Appearances are all 
too often deceptive. For instance, you might well commit an error in judgment if you went by appearances only with people like Edward Hyde Burton, the character created by Maugham. As far as appearance and manners were concerned, Burton seem
ed a man all of a piece. He 
was a tiny little fellow with white hair and mild blue eyes. Kind, gentle and candid, he was described by many as one of the most respectable people on earth. Nevertheless, he turned out to be cruel to a friend in need of his help. He insulted and fooled Turner who was down 
and 
out and made him commit himself to an insane venture. What was still more surprising was that he was completely indifferent to Turner's death. Without doubt, Burton was a man with a heart of stone.
